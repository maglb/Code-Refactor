# Code-Refactor
Module 1 Challenge

## Description

For this project, our task was to improve an existing code for web accessibility.  
Throughout this process, we learned to identify individual sections within the HTML file and implement semantic tags to improve accessibility.
I have learned to write more concise CSS style sheets and reorganizing the codebase for improved efficiency.

Below are the assigmemnt's requirements:

### User Story

* AS A marketing agency
* I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
* SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

### Acceptance Criteria

* GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
* WHEN I view the source code
* THEN I find semantic HTML elements
* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
* THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* WHEN I view the image elements
* THEN I find accessible alt attributes
* WHEN I view the heading attributes
* THEN they fall in sequential order
* WHEN I view the title element
